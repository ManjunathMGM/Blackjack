## ♦️ Blackjack Rules ♥️

In this Python Blackjack Game, we follow the classic rules of the game. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Objective:**
   - The main goal is to beat the dealer by having a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.

2. **Card Values:**
   - Number cards (2 - 10) are worth their face value.
   - Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10.
   - Aces can be worth 1 or 11, depending on which value benefits the hand more.

3. **The Deal:**
   - The player is initially dealt two cards.
   - The dealer is also dealt two cards, with one card face up and the other face down.

4. **Gameplay:**
   - The player can choose to 'hit' (take another card) or 'stand' (keep the current hand).
   - If the player's hand value exceeds 21, they 'bust' and lose the round.
   - The dealer reveals their face-down card after the player's turn.

5. **Dealer's Turn:**
   - The dealer must hit until their hand value is at least 17.
   - If the dealer busts, the player wins the round.

6. **Winning:**
   - The player wins if their hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer without busting.
   - If the player and dealer have the same hand value, it's a 'push' (tie).

7. **Blackjack:**
   - If a player is dealt an Ace and a 10-value card (10, Jack, Queen, King) as their initial two cards, they have a 'Blackjack' and usually win the round.

These are simplified rules, and there might be variations depending on the specific Blackjack variant you are playing.
